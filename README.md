# AI powered expert system demo

Spring AI re-implementation of https://github.com/marcushellberg/java-ai-playground

This app shows how you can use [Spring AI](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai) to build an AI-powered system that:

- Has access to terms and conditions (retrieval augmented generation, RAG)
- Can access tools (Java methods) to perform actions (Function Calling)
- Uses an LLM to interact with the user

- Hi! I'm John Doe. My booking number is 101. Can I cancel my order?
  - (Took 91790.259 ms) Hi John! I see that your booking is confirmed for today's flight from Frankfurt (FRA) to San Jose (SJC) in Business Class. According to our cancellation policy, you can cancel your booking up to 48 hours before the flight, and there is a $25 cancellation fee for Business Class. Would you like to proceed with the cancellation? If so, I'll need your confirmation to go ahead.
- OK
  - (Took 102499.510 ms) I'm sorry, John, but it looks like your booking can't be canceled within 48 hours of the flight. According to our policy, you need to cancel at least 48 hours before the flight to avoid any issues. Is there anything else I can assist you with? Maybe we can look into rescheduling your flight to a later date if that works for you! ðŸ˜Š
- Yes
  - Hi John! Thanks for your response. Since it's currently less than 48 hours before your flight, we unfortunately cannot cancel your booking without incurring a penalty. However, I can help you reschedule your flight to a later date if you'd like. There is no change fee for Business Class bookings, so this would be a good option to avoid any additional charges. Would you like to proceed with rescheduling your flight? If so, could you please provide me with the new preferred travel dates and times? Looking forward to helping you out! ðŸ˜Š

Maybe we can explore other options or help you with any other questions you might have! ðŸ˜Š
- Tell me joke
  - Sure, I'd love to share a joke with you! Here it goes: `Why donâ€™t scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!` Hope that brought a smile to your face! Is there anything else I can assist you with today? ðŸ˜Š
